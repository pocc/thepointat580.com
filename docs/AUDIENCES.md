## Audience Priorities (Estimated by Revenue Impact)

1. **Small business / office tenants** — Highest per-unit revenue, longest commitment
2. **Residential renters** — Stable recurring revenue
3. **Storefront / retail** — High-visibility tenants that attract foot traffic
4. **Warehouse tenants** — Large space utilization
5. **Virtual office / mailbox** — Low revenue per unit but zero vacancy cost, attracts future upgraders
6. **Current tenants** — Retention is cheaper than acquisition

## Gaps Identified

- **No testimonials or social proof** from any tenant category
- **No neighborhood lifestyle content** aimed at residential prospects (walkability, commute times, schools, dog-friendliness)
- **Homepage hero is generic** ("Welcome") — doesn't immediately communicate value to any audience
- **No audience-specific entry paths** from homepage (e.g., "I need an office" vs "I need an apartment")
- **Virtual office listing buried** — this is the lowest-friction offering and should be more prominent
- **No mention of what makes Point Richmond special for businesses** (e.g., affordability vs SF/Oakland, creative community)
