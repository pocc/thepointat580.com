# Image Assets

## Overview

All images in the React app (`src/`) were extracted from the legacy monolith HTML files,
which contain base64-encoded JPEGs inlined by the `monolith` capture tool. One additional
image was downloaded from the GoDaddy CDN (`img1.wsimg.com`).

## Extraction Process

The monolith HTML files contain 40+ base64-encoded JPEG segments total, but most are
responsive variants of the same image at different resolutions (generated by GoDaddy's
`<picture>` + `<source>` responsive image system with 1x/2x/3x srcsets at multiple
breakpoints). After visual deduplication, only **6 unique images** were identified.

### Extraction method
1. Python script using regex to find `data:image/jpeg;base64,...` patterns
2. Base64 decode each match, deduplicate by MD5 hash
3. Visual inspection to identify responsive variants of the same image
4. Largest (highest quality) version of each unique image kept
5. `richmond-aerial.jpg` downloaded separately from `img1.wsimg.com` CDN

### Monolith image counts
| File | Base64 JPEGs | Unique Images |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `index.html` | 15 | 2 (aerial, business couple) |
| `listings/index.html` | 27 | 3 (street view, building entrance, conference room) |
| `historic-area/index.html` | 4 | 1 (vintage B&W photo) |
| `contact-us/index.html` | 0 | 0 |
| `forms/index.html` | 0 | 0 |
